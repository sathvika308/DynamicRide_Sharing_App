# Dynamic Ride Sharing App using A* Algorithm

This project is a simple ride-sharing application that uses dynamic routing to find the shortest path from multiple sources to a single destination using the A* algorithm.

## Features
- Dynamic route calculation using A* shortest path algorithm  
- Web-based interface built using Flask  
- Displays optimal routes for ride sharing  
- Uses basic database storage for route and user data  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS  
- SQLite  

## Project Structure
- `app.py` – Main Flask application  
- `a_star.py` – Implementation of A* pathfinding algorithm  
- `templates/` – HTML files for the web interface  
- `static/` – CSS and static resources  
- `db.py` – Database handling  

## Note
This project was developed for academic learning purposes to understand routing algorithms and basic web application development.
